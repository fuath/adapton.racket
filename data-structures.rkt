;;create a top level table for nodes
(define *memo-table* 
  (make-hasheq))

;; create a top level table for cells
(define *cells*
  (make-hasheq))

;; the stack holds a list of articulation points (nodes or cells).
;; the top element of the stack is the "currently active" articulation
;; point. the stack is used to keep track of successor/predecessor 
;; relationships
(define stack (box '()))

;; create-stack mirrors the stack but has the element 00000 on the bottom.
;; when a node is created an edge is created between the new node and its
;; creator. having a seperate stack for create edges allows us to have 
;; creation edges between a "user node (00000)" and nodes with no predecessor.

;; create-edges are necessary for purge-unreachable to work properly, and require
;; the user to run the initial input by creating a thunk and storing it in 
;; the node 00000. The user then forces the user node to run his or her code.

;; For most of the functionality provided by adapton, this is not necessary.
;; You should attempt to familiarize yourself with most of the functionality
;; provided by adapton before worrying about create-edges or user nodes. 
(define create-stack (box '(00000)))

;; cell counter keeps track of the id of the last created cell, and is 
;; incremented each time a cell is created.
